Things that may or may not get done in the future...

* Use *setters* in `ATEMSwitcherState` data tree instead of `set`methods to change switcher settings.
* Allow the user to _watch_ individual switcher settings (e.g watching `switcher.programInput[0].videoSource` changes to make a tally light).
* Test connection with multiple switchers at once (multiple `PyATEMMax.ATEMMax()` instances)
* Fix linting mess.
* Implement missing methods from ATEMmax relative to MediaPlayerStillFiles.
* Upgrade to new protocol versions.
