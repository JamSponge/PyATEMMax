I'm trying to keep this code nice and clean by using linters. While this won't bother normal users, if you are planning to check the code you may get confused about linter configurations for `pyright` and `pylance`, as well as the `pylint` configuration file... It's a mess, I know it and I'll try to fix it someday.
